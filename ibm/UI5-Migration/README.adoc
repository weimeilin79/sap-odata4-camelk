The example file are under Ric's repo 
https://github.com/rickgcv/shopping_cart or you can find it under this folder. 

The UI5 is basically an NODE JS app. We first create the docker file to containerize it. 

```
FROM node:16

WORKDIR  /usr/src/socreate

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
RUN npm install ngrok -g

COPY . .

# Build frontend JS assets
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

And quickly found there are things missing to run it, IBM developer were running it in their local machine, with npx commend. But this was not given to us. We had to add the start script in order to make it run properly. in _*package.json*_

```
"scripts": {
    "build": "ui5 build --clean-dest --include-task=generateManifestBundle generateCachebusterInfo",
    "start": "ui5 serve -o index.html"
  }
```

We can now build the docker image, and run it locally. 
```
docker build . -t socreate
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 socreate 
```

Get the container id, and ssh into the running instance
```
docker ps
docker exec -it  <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash
```

Since the UI5 only runs on 127.0.0.1(which means only accessible by localhost), we can test it by tunnelling it with ngrok, run this inside the container.

```
ngrok http 8080
```

You shoud be prompted with the infomation of the tunnel.

You should be able to access it by going to the http://xxxxx.ngrok.io from the prompted info. 
We are now ready to push the containerized application to our container hub (quay.io). 

```
docker tag <CONTAINER_ID> quay.io/<YOUR_REPO>/socreate
docker push quay.io/<YOUR_REPO>/socreate
```

And don't forget to make your quay.io/<YOUR_REPO>/socreate repo _*PUBLIC*_

Let's go ahead and deploy the UI5 application.

```
oc new-app quay.io/<YOUR_REPO>/socreate:latest --as-deployment-config

```

*BUT WAIT!!* Things don't stop here!
Since UI5 only does binds to _*localhost*_ (weird..), we need to add a proxy that can tunnel traffics to it. 
In your _socreate_ DeploymentConfig, add sidecar container

```
spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: quay.io/weimei79/nginx-sidecar
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8081
              protocol: TCP
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 500m
              memory: 1Gi
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          terminationMessagePolicy: File
          imagePullPolicy: Always
```

And that will start the proxy, and since this NGINX proxy starts on port 8081, make sure you update all related setting on OpenShift. 

```
oc delete svc socreate
oc expose dc socreate --port=8181
oc expose svc socreate
```

And that should do the trick. Migrate and deploy all three applications, 
- back_office_so
- shopping_cart
- so_approval
and you are all set to go.
